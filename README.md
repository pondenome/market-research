# market-research
For planning and executing market research (surveys, interviews, etc.)

## Informal interviews
### What?
- A short sample of questions to ask friends/family in an informal interview.

### Why?
- Once we have collected enough we will process the answers and write out a survey to send out to a global audience.
- We need to learn more about what people actually want from a social network but also to try and dig out our own technical insight (killer app idea).

### How to contribute
- checkout the repository
- inside the `informal-interviews` folder
- copy the `questions` folder into `answers` as a folder under your own name e.g. `/answers/john-doe`
- for each question put your answer directly below the question (example in `/answers/john-doe/demographic.txt`)
- once you have collected all of your answers commit and push into the repository
- Thanks :)

### Questions
- What if I do not get to ask questions from all categories?
  - It's fine if you don't get through all of the questions, just include categories and questions you have answers for
- What if I do not understand one of the questions or even the answers?
  - Ask on the channel or do your best to capture what you can of the result
- Any other comments/questions please post them on the `#market-research` chat channel.
